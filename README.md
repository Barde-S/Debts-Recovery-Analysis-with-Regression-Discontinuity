# Bank Recovery Strategy Analysis

## Project Description

In the complex world of banking and debt recovery, making strategic decisions on how to assign delinquent customers to different recovery strategies is crucial. This project dives into a scenario where a bank employs various recovery strategies based on the expected amount they anticipate recovering from each customer. The primary goal is to assess, in this non-random assignment, whether the incremental amount earned surpasses the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.

Threshold assignments, like the one in this project, are prevalent in various domains such as medicine, education, finance, and the public sector. Regression discontinuity, a powerful analysis method, proves invaluable in situations involving threshold assignments.

**Project Tasks:**

### 1. Regression Discontinuity: Banking Recovery
   - Explore the concept of regression discontinuity in the context of banking recovery strategies.

### 2. Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Conduct graphical exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the recovery strategy data.

### 3. Statistical Test: Age vs. Expected Recovery Amount
   - Apply statistical tests to analyze the relationship between age and the expected recovery amount.

### 4. Statistical Test: Sex vs. Expected Recovery Amount
   - Investigate the impact of gender on the expected recovery amount through statistical testing.

### 5. Exploratory Graphical Analysis: Recovery Amount
   - Visualize the distribution of recovery amounts for a comprehensive understanding.

### 6. Statistical Analysis: Recovery Amount
   - Conduct statistical analysis on recovery amounts, exploring patterns and trends.

### 7. Regression Modeling: No Threshold
   - Develop a regression model without incorporating a threshold, laying the foundation for comparison.

### 8. Regression Modeling: Adding True Threshold
   - Introduce a true threshold to regression modeling, enhancing model accuracy and relevance.

### 9. Regression Modeling: Adjusting the Window
   - Fine-tune the regression model by adjusting the window, ensuring optimal performance.

Join this data-driven exploration of banking recovery strategies, employing regression discontinuity and statistical analysis to make informed decisions in the intricate realm of debt recovery.
